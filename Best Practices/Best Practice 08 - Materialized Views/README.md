# Best Practice 08 - Materialized Views

## Overview

Materialized views are seen as a best practice due to their ability to greatly enhance query performance for frequently run analytics queries. They achieve this by pre-computing and storing the results of complex operations, such as joins, aggregations, and filters. This leads to faster response times on large datasets, particularly in data lakes, thanks to Iceberg's efficient data management and metadata tracking features. Here are the key benefits of Iceberg materialized views:

- **Faster Query Response** By storing precomputed results, materialized views enable quicker access to data, significantly reducing query execution times.
- **Efficiency for Complex Operations** They optimize the performance of complex queries, such as those involving joins and aggregations, which can be resource-intensive.
- **Reduced Computational Load** By handling frequently executed queries with materialized views, the overall computational burden on the system is minimized, allowing resources to be used more effectively.
- **Improved Data Accessibility** Materialized views simplify access to summarized or transformed data, making it easier for users, especially those without technical expertise.
- **Current Data Representation** These views can be refreshed to reflect updates in the underlying data, ensuring users always work with the most accurate and up-to-date information.
- **Support for Incremental Refreshes** Iceberg allows for incremental updates to materialized views, enabling efficient refreshes without the need for complete recomputation.
- **Enhanced Reporting and Analytics** Materialized views can be tailored to specific reporting needs, providing flexibility in how data is presented and analyzed.
- **Compatibility with BI Tools** They integrate well with business intelligence tools, facilitating easier report generation and dashboard creation.
- **Lower Latency** Caching results help reduce latency in analytics workflows, enabling near real-time insights.
- **Adaptability to Diverse Workloads** Materialized views can support various analytics workloads, accommodating both batch and real-time processing needs.

By adopting materialized views, organizations can enhance their data analytics capabilities, achieving better performance, efficiency, and accessibility.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW transaction_aggregation 
PARTITIONED ON (col4)
STORED BY ICEBERG STORED AS PARQUET
AS
SELECT tbl1.col1, tbl2.col4, count(tbl1.amount) as total_amt 
FROM tbl1 JOIN tbl2 ON tbl1.id = tbl2.id 
GROUP BY tbl1.col1, tbl2.col4;
```

## IceTip

Leverage Materialized Views to pre-compute most common aggregation for end-user and BI projects. With MV, creating, maintaining, and evolving those business views will be much easier from the data management perspective.

Only INSERT transactions will perform an incremental rebuild. Under other conditions, will force a full rebuild.
