#  Best Practice 05 - Storage Optimization

## Overview
Storage optimization is considered a best practice because it significantly improves query performance on large datasets within a data lake by efficiently managing metadata, enabling features like partition pruning, and minimizing unnecessary data scans, leading to faster query execution and reduced storage costs, especially when dealing with massive data volumes. 

Organizations can optimize Iceberg storage by:
- **Proper Partitioning** by designing partitions based on query patterns to effectively prune irrelevant data.
- **Data File Consolidation** by regularly compacting small data files into larger ones to improve query performance.
- **Snapshot Management** by cleaning up old snapshots to avoid unnecessary storage usage,
- **Leverage Statistics** as a rule of thumb, utilize data statistics to further optimize query execution plans. 

## IceTip
Understand the data retention requirements according to the use case, project, business needs, or local regulations. Then automate jobs to expire the snapshots that are no longer needed periodically.

```sql
ALTER TABLE test_table EXECUTE expire_snapshots('2021-12-09 05:39:18);
```
